# Burning Furnace Array (Redstone + Coal)

One of the many problems that you may encounter in the beginning of your adventure is the inability to keep your furnace lit. A lit furnace can mean the difference between having a full stomach and strong weapons or starving in a cave.
The Burning Furnace array, as the name implies, will provide a much needed heat source for any nearby furnace. By placing the array directly adjacent to a vanilla furnace (it can be next to multiple), it will provide fuel to the furnace if an operation is able to be completed - nothing will happen if it is next to an empty or a full furnace, mainly for your protection.
This does not come for free, however: when a person is nearby (within a 10 block radius), it will take away half a heart of health in order to cook up to two things in the furnace. This will be helpful to either get a quick bite or to smelt a full stack of ore, but unfortunately you haven't found a way to add any safety measures to the array...

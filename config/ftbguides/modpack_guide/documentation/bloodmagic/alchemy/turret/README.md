# Turret Array (Bow + Arrow)

The power of flinging pointy objects at far away monsters cannot be overstated. The Turret Array is able to sense a nearby hostile monster and by utilizing complex alchemical mechanisms it is able to draw back and fire an arrow in order to strike its target.
The array searches for an inventory directly beneath it. If it finds either a normal or tipped arrow it will syphon from its container and fire at a mob that is within a 32 block radius.
(Due to some silly Minecraft physics that has arrows bounce off of entities that are too close to where they spawn, the turret will also only fire on a mob that is greater than 3 blocks away. Keep that in mind!)

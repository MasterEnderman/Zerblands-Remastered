# Fast Miner Array (Mining Reagent + Iron Pickaxe)

When tasked with carving out a large area of land, sometimes it is best to just do it by hand. For those occasions, this array is for you. The array applies a Haste III buff to players within a 10 block radius, costing the user 1 HP per 30 seconds. Because it is a general Haste buff, it will also increase your attack speed while in its area of effect, though you will have to be careful since other players will benefit from this too!

# Skeleton Turret Array (Arrow + Feather)

By utilizing the Demon Will that is still controlling a mob, you can take over the mind of a skeleton in order to make it do your bidding. If a skeleton finds itself inside of the area of this array, it will act as a sentry and attack hostile monsters nearby. Unfortunately this array is still highly experimental, so it may not work very well or consistently.

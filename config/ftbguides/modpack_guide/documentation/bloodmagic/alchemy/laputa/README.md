# Shard of Laputa (Redstone + Lapis Lazuli Block)

There exists a story of a lost kingdom that had such advanced magic that it could fly through the clouds. Although this kingdom has since crumbled to dust, a few drawings of this castle in the sky has managed to provide exquisite detail as to the mechanisms that allowed it to become the legend that it is.
The Shard of Laputa converts the life essence that is found within the earth into a more avian form, causing the surrounding area to levitate in the air. While the underlying principle is simple, the variations of the life essence in the earth cause a bit of inconsistency in how much land is moved. The array will move the earth in a spherical radius between 4 and 8 blocks up above itself a random offset between one and 5 blocks plus twice the radius of the effect.
It should be noted that as soon as the effect starts, all items used to activate the array will be lost.

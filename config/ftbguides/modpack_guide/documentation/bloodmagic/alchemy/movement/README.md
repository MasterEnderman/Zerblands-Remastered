# Movement Array (Feather + Redstone)

The Movement Array creates a small vortex of air at its center and uses a small amount of energy to heat it up. After that, once an animal or any other type of entity walks into its area of effect, they will be launched forward in the direction that it was placed in by the force of the air. What is more, if fallen onto from a large height, the array will eliminate the fall damage that would have incurred. Just be prepared for some mild motion afterward.
The direction of motion is in the direction of the arrow on the array.
It should also be noted that you will gain a much greater distance if you fall or jump onto the array than if you simply walked into its area. This has to do with the turbulence from your movements causing a much greater reaction.

# Bouncing Array (Slimeball + Redstone)

By using a source of heat near its center that is pushed downward, the array attempts to soften the ground underneath it. After it has done this, it then converts carbon and hydrogen into a rubbery material inside of the earth. This combination causes any entity to impact the surface to bounce in the air and eliminating the fall damage that would otherwise be sustained. This bouncing can be stopped by simply shifting, and it will still cushion your fall.

# Penance of the Leadened Soul

In order to gain more power, sometimes you have to sacrifice something in return. The Penance of the Leadened Soul does just that - by sacrificing a few items to an unseen entity, you may reduce the effectiveness of some aspect of your Living Armour and get an increase in the number of upgrade points as compensation. When you construct the ritual you have to place an item frame on the top-most Blank ritual stone facing towards the Master Ritual stone, and some sort of inventory (see: chest) on top of the Dusk ritual stone. To acquire a Living Armour Downgrade, you then have to place the key item in the item frame and the consumables in the chest. Once the ritual is activated, you can sneak on top of the Master Ritual Stone at any time and acquire the downgrade.
In the case of the Quenched Living Armour Downgrade, its key item is a water bottle (placed in the item frame) and the recipe is Dragon's Breath (placed in the chest). The key item is never consumed, but the recipe is.
In order to view the recipe for the downgrades you can look them up in JEI - check the usage of the Master Ritual Stone and you will see the recipes for the Penance ritual. Also you can just check the recipe for the max level downgrade in JEI and then check the usage of the key item - the key item is always the same for the specific downgrade.

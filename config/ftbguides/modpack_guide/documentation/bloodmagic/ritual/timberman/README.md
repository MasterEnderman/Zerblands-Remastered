# Crash of the Timberman

Got wood? This ritual has you covered. The Crash of the Timberman tethers a spectral entity using the LP of the owner to harvest the leaves and logs of all trees within its range and places the results inside of the connected chest. It will try to find all "trees" in a 10 block horizontal radius and up to 30 blocks above the MRS (by default) and use 10LP per felled block.

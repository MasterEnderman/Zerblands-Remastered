# Call of the Zephyr

Modelled after an ancient sword of proverb, the Call of the Zephyr uses the power of wind to collect the items that are around it and place them inside of the linked chest (default is right above the MRS). This is done instantly, meaning that the items are teleported directly into the inventory - no need to worry about weird suction effects!
The default item radius is 5 blocks away from the MRS.

# Aura of Expulsion

If you play on a server you can face a situation where you have unwanted player visitors. Sometimes force fields and giant bloody rotors are not enough of a deterrent and they still manage to get into your base. This ritual attempts to alleviate this through the use of teleportation magic!
If a player that is not the owner enters the range of the ritual (default 12 block radius) the ritual will teleport the player randomly within a radius of 100 blocks away. However, if there is a chest on top of the MRS with a bound item from a player that player will be exempted from the teleportation, acting effectively like a whitelist.
The ritual costs 2000LP per successful teleportation.

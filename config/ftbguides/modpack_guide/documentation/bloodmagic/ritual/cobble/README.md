# Le Vulcanos Frigius

Got tired of making one of these primitive buildings to generate cobblestone? Got tired of having OSHA on you or accidentally extinguishing your lava source? This ritual is for you. Generate insurmountable masses of cobblestone in a fast and efficient way with future-proof blood instead of using dangerous and limited lava (unless you generate lava from blood, that is).
This ritual generates (by default) cobblestone on top of itself which can then be mined for personal use.

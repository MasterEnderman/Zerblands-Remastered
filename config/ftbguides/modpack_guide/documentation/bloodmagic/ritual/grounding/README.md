# Ritual of Grounding

The Ritual of Grounding manipulates the gravity in its area. By default, it drags mobs to the ground and prevents jumping.
Supplying the ritual with Raw Will makes it affect players in addition to mobs.
Corrosive Will simply disables gravity all together.
Destructive Will vastly increases fall damage of affected entities.
Steadfast Will allows the ritual to affect bosses.
Vengeful Will alone amplifies the grounding effect, in combination with Corrosive Will, however, it transforms the ritual to provide levitation instead. Vengeful Will also increases the effect of Heavy Heart, increasing fall damage even more.

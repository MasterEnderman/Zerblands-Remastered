# Laying of the Filler

As many are aware, being able to place blocks can be important in various automation tasks. This ritual takes the items/blocks from the connected chest (defaults to on top of the MRS) and places the blocks within the ritual, which is a radius of 2 on the same level as the MRS. This can be useful if you are trying to lay out saplings for a tree farm or if there are other blocks that must be placed. The ritual takes 50LP per successful operation.

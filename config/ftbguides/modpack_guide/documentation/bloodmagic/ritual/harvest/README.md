# Reap of the Harvest Moon

This ritual will seek any harvestable plant block within its range (default is the 9x9x5 high area above the MRS) and try to harvest it, replanting any seeds if the plant can drop seeds. All of the drops from the plant will appear where the plant was harvested. The ritual will attempt to harvest plants once every 5 ticks and will cost 20LP per successful operation.
Plants that can be harvested include, but are not limited to: pumpkins, wheat, carrots, potatos, nether wart, cactus, reeds. Keep in mind that the ritual makes no assumptions about the thing it is harvesting - it can only harvest mod-added crops if the mod in question registers a harvesting handler with the mod.

# Ritual of Speed

As the name may suggest, the Ritual of Speed is used for transportation of various sorts. The ritual may be placed in the direction of any of the cardinal directions and any entities within its range will be launched in the direction that the ritual is pointing. When looking at a ritual, this direction is where the dusk ritual stone is. By default, the ritual has a radius of 2 blocks from the MRS, though this can be expanded or contracted when using a ritual tinkerer. This will apply a speed of 3 blocks/tick in the direction of the ritual and 1.2 blocks/tick vertically.
If the ritual is fueled with Raw Will, the speed of the ritual is increased substantially based on the Will that is in the Aura. For instance, the speed will be doubled if there is 100 Will inside of the Aura. For each successful operation, 0.1 Will is consumed.
Vengeful Will prevents the ritual from moving adult mobs, and Destructive Will prevents the ritual from moving child mobs. If either one of these are used, players are also prevented from using the ritual. If both of them are used, however, the effect is that only players may use the ritual and mobs cannot. These augmentations can be used effectively for sorting animal farms or even getting rid of those pesky child zombies in your sacrificial pen. The ritual will consume 0.05 Will for each type that is in effect on successful operation, so if a child enters the ritual space when you use Destructive Will it will not cost Will or LP.

# Ritual of Regeneration

Arguably one of the best rituals for any potential Blood Mage who wishes to use his own life force to fuel his magic, the Ritual of Regeneration casts a veil of energy around itself, healing entities that find themselves within its range. Every 2.5 seconds the ritual will cast Regeneration I on living entities in its 15 block radius, costing 100LP per player and 10LP per other living entities for the 2.5 seconds of regen.
If Corrosive Will is used to augment the ritual a second range will be available, a "vampiric range". Any non-player entities within this range will be randomly damaged in order to directly heal players within the regular healing range. This costs 0.04 Will to use and will transfer 1HP per operational tick.

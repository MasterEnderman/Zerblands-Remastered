# The Gate of the Fold

The Gate of the Fold is a ritual made for interdimensional teleportation without the need of additional interaction. Upon activation, all blocks that touch its ritual stones are used as a key pattern to link portals together. If another Gate of the Fold with the same key exists, the rituals will be linked together and walking through instantly teleports to its twin. Only up to 2 portals with the same key can exist at the same time.
Activation Cost: 50,000LP
Teleportation Cost: 1,000LP (same dimension) / 10,000LP (different dimensions)

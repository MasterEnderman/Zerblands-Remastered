# Ritual of Containment

The opposite of Interdiction, the Ritual of Containment attempts to pull mobs within its area of effect towards the space above the MRS, suspending them in the air where they cannot move. The default range of the ritual is a 3 block horizontal radius from the bottom of the master stone to the top of the top-most runes, though this range can of course be altered.
This ritual costs 1LP per mob pulled every tick.

# Ritual of Interdiction

Based on an archaic alchemical device of legend, the Ritual of Interdiction attempts to forcibly push all non-player mobs away from the center of the ritual. By default, all mobs that are within two blocks of the MRS are pushed away from the MRS by setting their velocity. It should be noted that mobs within this range are not affected by fall damage, though that safety net wears off as soon as they are pushed away.

# Ritual of the High Jump

This ritual uses a huge burst of air to propel all those who walk on top of it into the sky. What is more, if the user lands in the ritual's area of effect they will not suffer any fall damage. Players who sneak inside this ritual also are not affected.
The ritual costs 5LP per entity per tick of successful operation, so it won't cost anything if it doesn't fling people in the air.

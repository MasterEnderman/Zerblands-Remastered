# Mark of the Falling Tower

For all intents and purposes, this is one of the most powerful rituals currently in the game. It costs one million LP to activate and can only be used once before needing to be reactivated. The ritual, once specific sacrifices are made, pulls a meteor from outer space and causes it to plummet towards the ground, causing a large explosion once it hits something solid. Because these meteors are not from the Overworld, they can hold a rich ore density never seen anywhere else.
Sacrifices can include: an iron block, a gold block, a diamond. This is configurable by the modpack or user.

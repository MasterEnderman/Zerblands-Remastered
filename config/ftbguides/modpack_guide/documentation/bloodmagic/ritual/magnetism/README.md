# The Ritual of Magnetism

The Ritual of Magnetism is the bread and butter of anyone who enjoys quarries. The ritual creates a revolving magnetic field, pulling up the rich ores from the ground underneath it and placing the contents in its area. This does not displace any rock, so no gaping holes will appear in the land - assuming that the land isn't made up entirely of ore. The ritual operates once every 40 ticks and costs 50LP per successful operation.
The default radius that this ritual operates is 3 blocks in each cardinal direction, giving an area of 7x7 blocks centered on the MRS. Because the ritual currently does not have any Will augments, you can only increase the radius of effect for the ritual by placing a valuable block directly underneath the MRS. If an iron block is used the radius becomes 7. If a gold block is used, the radius becomes 15. Finally, if a diamond block is used the radius expands to 31, meaning any ores below the ritual in a 63x63 area will be slowly pulled up into its 3x3x3 volume above the MRS.

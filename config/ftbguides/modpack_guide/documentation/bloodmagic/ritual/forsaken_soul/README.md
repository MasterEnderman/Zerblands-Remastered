# Gathering of the Forsaken Souls

The Gathering of the Forsaken Souls speeds up Demon Crystal growth for crystal clusters above the ritual (by default). It does not generate will on its own though and still requires the crystal clusters to have Demon Crystallizers below them. In order to do that, it utilizes a mechanic known as "uniqueness" of mobs. The more different mobs die, the more efficent the crystal growth will be. It does not itself generate Demonic Will Aura though, so you need to supply it by either feeding back crystals or putting a Tartaric Gem with will into a Demon Crucible. This should eliminate the need for going out to farm demonic will unless you fail to supply mobs to feed it and/or run out of will.

# The Architect

## Foreword

Hello, everyone. My name is Tiberius. You can probably tell by this entry that the book is not exactly complete, and you would be right. Because of the 1.7.10 -> 1.8.9 and 1.9.4 (and above) updates, a lot of stuff has changed in the mod. As such, the books have had to be rewritten. Because the ultimate plan for these documents is to have each book in the form of a research journal / actual book, these documents will take a while to flesh out. As such, I am going to be updating this book periodically in order to fill in the necessary gaps. It will start as flavourless garbage to start with (Yeah... not the most appetizing of illustrations to go with for documents, but whatever!), but slowly it will be morphed into a story about a bunch of blood magi on a journey through discovery.
But enough about that, I need to get into character. *Cough cough*
My name is Tiberius, and I am a Blood Mage, and also otherwise known as The Architect. This book contains all of my research regarding the ethereal phenomenon called the "Soul Network," as well as the physical properties of some of the most central devices that any Blood Mage in training should be accustomed to. From the art of laying out the structure of a powerful Blood Altar, to the intricacies of sacrificing life force to increase a mage's power, and further to the powers gained through arcane glyphs and sigils, I have discovered, revised, and created new ways into train one's self to new heights.
So enter, Mage, for a new realm awaits you!
...Yeah, Magus says that I can get a little grandiose, but what can you do?

# Lava Sigil

The Yang to the Water Sigil's Yin, this sigil heats up the rock in the local area and gathers it in one place, forming a source of lava where the sigil makes contact. A similar process occurs when you interact on a fluid-accepting machine, generating up to 1000mB of lava inside of the machine for the same cost. For some reason your hand is not burnt when you use it, however it doesn't mean that it is a wise choice to take a bath in it! 1000LP per use.

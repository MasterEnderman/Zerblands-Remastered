# Sigil of the Fast Miner

As any good Blood Mage should be aware of, blood has a high amount of iron within it. If skilled enough, one can manipulate blood while it is still within the body - it should be noted, however, that only the most advanced Blood Mages can twist the blood of those that are unwilling.
One of the principle uses is to accelerate the functions of one's own body. By magnetising the iron in the user's blood, the Sigil of the Fast Miner increases the speed of mining dramatically, applying Haste II while activated. This magnetism is too weak to affect things outside of one's own body, however it is sufficient enough to mine obsidian at a considerable speed.

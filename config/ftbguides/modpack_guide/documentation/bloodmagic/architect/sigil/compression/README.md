# Sigil of Compression

A miner will quickly find that during a long expedition their inventory will become filled with redstone dust, lapis, and several other materials. Most of these have recipes that will compress them down to storage blocks such as redstone blocks and blocks of diamonds, however they normally require a crafting table in order to combine them.
This sigil creases a miniature field of compression in the inventory of the user when activated, compressing items down to the lowest number of slots needed for the inventory. What this means is that if you have 63 redstone dust it will not do anything. However, if you have 64 dust it will compress 9 of them into a block of redstone. While this is technically not the ideal situation if you have exactly a stack of redstone dust, it will guarantee that you aren't left in the dust due to full pockets. If other mods are present this will work for other crafting recipes as well.

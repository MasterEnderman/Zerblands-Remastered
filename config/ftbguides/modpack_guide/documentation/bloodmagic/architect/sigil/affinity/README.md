# Sigil of Elemental Affinity

At first glance, the Sigil of Elemental Affinity simply grants immunity to fire, drowning, and damage from heights while activated. Its operation is a lot more nuanced, however. This sigil creates a thin barrier of air around the user by using the sweat (and when required, blood) from the user, keeping the body away from the harsh elements.
This air barrier acts as a buffer between the skin and the fire or lava, circulating when required to prevent overheating. It also fills the lungs while under water to equalize the pressure of the body and the surrounding water. Finally, when falling from a large height, the air will shift to below the person's feet, acting as a cushion to dampen the fall.

# Sigil of Suppression

The Sigil of Suppression uses the technology that is used in a Teleposer in order to temporarily displace fluids that are near it when active. This is done by teleposing the liquids in a sphere around the user to a hidden pocket dimension, replacing the liquid with air. Unfortunately, because you are overcharging the field used by the Teleposer, the teleposition is temporary - if the user walks away from the area that the liquid was teleposed away from or deactivates the sigil, the liquids will pop back where they were before as if nothing has happened, assuming that there are no newly-placed blocks there. This allows for fancy transportation when on foot, walking under the water instead of swimming through it or even parting the red seas of the Nether.

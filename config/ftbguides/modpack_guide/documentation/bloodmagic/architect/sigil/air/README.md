# Air Sigil

The Air Sigil uses a rudimentary form of fission to generate a steady stream of air behind the user by the traces of water vapour in the air, propelling them forward. In essence, by using this sigil you can be launched forward a considerable distance. It should be noted that the sigil will only cancel the user's fall distance when used, so if you want to stick the landing you have to use it close to the ground!

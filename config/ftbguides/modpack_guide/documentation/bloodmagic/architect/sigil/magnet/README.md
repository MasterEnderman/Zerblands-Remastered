# Sigil of Magnetism

This sigil magnetizes the iron in the blood stream of the user to attract small objects towards the sigil, allowing a quick and painless pickup. In essence this acts as an item magnet, but instead of actually "vacuuming" up items towards the player, it causes the player to pick up the item from a distance, so items don't need to fly around the place. Thankfully the magnetism is tuned so that it does not attract living objects, so you won't find creepers suddenly wanting to hug you at Mach 3.

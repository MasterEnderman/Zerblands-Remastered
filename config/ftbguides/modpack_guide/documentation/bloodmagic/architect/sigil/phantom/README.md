# Sigil of the Phantom Bridge

When activated and while the user is on solid ground, the Sigil of the Phantom Bridge solidifies the air beneath the user so that they may walk on it, essentially creating a Phantom Bridge. When you are shifting in the air, the bridge will instead form directly underneath you, allowing you to catch yourself in the air if you were falling. Although some calibration is needed in order to make it more effective for vertical travel as well as horizontal travel when moving quickly (due to lag messing up the creation of the bridge), it is a fancy way to effectively fly to different areas.

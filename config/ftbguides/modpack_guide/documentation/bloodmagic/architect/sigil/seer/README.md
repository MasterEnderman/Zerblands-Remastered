# Seer's Sigil

When tinkering around with the Blood Altar, you can sometimes get lost in the hidden intricacies of its operation that the Divination Sigil seems to be unable to divine. This is where the Seer's Sigil comes into play. Essentially an upgrade to the Divination Sigil, this sigil provides additional information about different stats of the altar. These range from the speed of the altar, the current LP, as well as the current progress of the crafted item. It also gives info about the player's soul network.

# Water Sigil

The Water Sigil, as the name suggests, is able to gather moisture from the air to create a source of water at the point of contact on the ground. What is more, by clicking on a machine that accepts a fluid, you can insert up to 1000mB of water into the machine for the same cost as if you put it on the ground. For all intents and purposes, it acts as an infinite bucket of water - it won't work if you place it inside of a machine, however. 50LP per use.

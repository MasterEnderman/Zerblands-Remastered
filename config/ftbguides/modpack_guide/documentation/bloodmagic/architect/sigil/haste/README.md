# Sigil of Haste

Sugar and caffeine are interesting chemicals that the human body can process. One acts as a reservoir of energy that is quickly burned, whereas the other increases your wakefulness and allows you to access energy in other means. By mimicking these chemical processes to unleash more chemical energy, the Sigil of Haste allows the user to increase their movement abilities.
While activated, the user can run a lot faster and is able to jump significantly higher. What is more, the sigil also offers "Step Assist," which allows the user to step up one block high ridges without needing to jump. It's like auto-jump, but less sucky.

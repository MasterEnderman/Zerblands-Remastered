# Sigil of the Green Grove

By using your blood as a simple growth catalyst of sorts, the Sigil of the Green Grove will increase the growth speed of any plants in a nearby area while activated. To activate the sigil, shift-right click it to toggle between activated and deactivated (easily seen by the tooltip or by the glowing symbols on the sigil). Keep in mind that every few seconds the sigil will syphon a bit of LP from the user to fuel the accelerated growth.
If used directly on a plant, the sigil will apply a bone-meal effect. This can be used to grow tall grass or other crops, just the same as bone-meal.

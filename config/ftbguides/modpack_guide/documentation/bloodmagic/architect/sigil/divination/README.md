# Divination Sigil

The Divination Sigil is one of the most useful tools in the mod, able to tell you many values that will make your life easier. This sigil is crafted using a piece of redstone and a blank slate (crafted in the Blood Altar) using an alchemy array.
When you right click a Blood Altar with the sigil, you can see the current tier, amount of LP inside of the main basin, as well as the max capacity of the Blood Altar. Spam-clicking the altar with the sigil will overwrite the previous text from the sigil, meaning that there will not be any spam in your chat.
If you right click in the air with the sigil, the sigil will tell you the current amount of LP that is in your Soul Network. Although this is rather mundane to start with, this function alone will make it very likely that you will want to keep this sigil on you at all times.

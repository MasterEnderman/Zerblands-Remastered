# Sigil of the Blood Lamp

There are quite a few "impurities" within the body and a person's blood. By harvesting some noble gases and encasing them with a source of heat, you can generate a ball of light that can be flung a large distance, sticking to the surface that it impacts with.
The Sigil of the Blood Lamp has two uses: you can either directly click a block and place a light source or fire a projectile that will generate a source of light at the point of contact. These light sources can be broken just like torches in one hit.

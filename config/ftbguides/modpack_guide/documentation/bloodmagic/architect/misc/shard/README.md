# Weak Blood Shard

Everything that has life can have the ethereal connections that is known as the Soul Network. As seen in your experiences, non-living things can also have a Soul Network attached to them, such as sigils and rituals; however, these connections are the strongest in creatures and, naturally, humans. 
When you attack a monster with a Bound Blade, their Soul Network temporarily hardens and a piece of it will remain after death. This piece takes the form of a Weak Blood Shard, so named after the fact its reddish hue matches the colour of the Weak Blood Orb. At this point, it is not clear if there are stronger forms of blood shards, but you can tell that this would be very helpful in increasing the power of your own Soul Network

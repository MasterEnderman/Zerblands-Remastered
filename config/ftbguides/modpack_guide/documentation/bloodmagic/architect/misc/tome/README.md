# Tome of Peritia

In the world, certain actions impress experiences on a person: slaying monsters, mining elements, and smelting ingots or food can give experience that is accumulated over a period of time. Through some arcane mechanisms, some structures and devices actually drains these experiences from you in order to fuel their own processes. It can therefore be useful to store these experiences in some medium.
Although some containers store experience as a physical substance, the Tome of Peritia allows the person to transcribe their experiences into the book - by writing in the tome, the pages are imbued with your thoughts and past actions, storing them away for later use. If you then want to acquire these experiences back, you can hold your hand to the page and syphon them back; this will remove the writing from the page and transmit those actions back to your memory.
Now for the actual usage; by shift-right clicking the tome in your hand, you can store a level of experience into the book (or down to the level if you have a partial level). Right clicking with the tome will grant you up to the next level if there is enough experience stored in the book. The total experience, as well as the equivalent level stored, is displayed on the tooltip of the tome.

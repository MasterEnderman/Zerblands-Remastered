# Lava Crystal

The lava crystal is a stone that has a piece of lava encased in the center of it that does not lose its heat. When placed as a fuel source inside of a furnace, it will "burn" for an amount that is enough to cook a single item in a standard furnace at the cost of 50LP from the owner's network. If the network does not have enough power in it (or if there is no owner) the crystal will simply not burn and will inflict nausea on the owner due to the strain.
This crystal will work for any solid fuel burning machine that accepts any fuel.

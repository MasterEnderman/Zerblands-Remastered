# Arcane Ash

Although not strictly part of the overall theme of this book, Arcane Ash is necessary in order to progress through the mod and get some of the more powerful devices available. This ash is crafted using the Hellfire Forge and Demon Will, so if you are new to this concept please consult the "Demon Kin." In essence, this is a way to craft items out of two separate items: a reagent of some sort to act as a catalyst, and a secondary item.
The ash has a total of twenty uses before you need to craft another. When you right click on the ground (or a wall, though it will only render one direction), you will inscribe a simple circle out of ash. If you click on the ash again with an item, it will be "placed inside of the ash" - assuming that this item is a valid catalyst, the circle will change shape to represent that it is ready for the next item. If it doesn't change shape, then you did something wrong.
Once it has changed shape, you can then place in the secondary item. If this item matches with the first item, the circle will start rotating and performing different actions depending on the recipe it is working on. After a while, if properly executed, an item will pop out.
All of the recipes for the Arcane Ash crafting (I call it Alchemy Array Crafting) can be found in JEI by checking the uses for Arcane Ash - the first item shown is the catalyst, and the second item is the secondary item.

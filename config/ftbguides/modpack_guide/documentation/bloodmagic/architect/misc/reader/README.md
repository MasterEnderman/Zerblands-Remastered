# Inspectoris Scandalum (Block Reader)

Literally "Block Reader" in Latin, this item's purpose is to give you more information about the more complex blocks in the mod when the blocks are in the world. Currently the only implementation for this item is the Blood Altar, and by simply shift-right clicking on a Blood Altar in the world it will tell you what blocks are required in the world for the next altar tier.
If this method doesn't suit you, you may shift-right click the item in the air to cycle through the tiers. If you then shift-right click on the altar, the altar will display ghost blocks in the world, showing exactly where the blood runes and the pillars are required in order to achieve that tier.  If you set the displayed tier to 1, it will remove the hologram.

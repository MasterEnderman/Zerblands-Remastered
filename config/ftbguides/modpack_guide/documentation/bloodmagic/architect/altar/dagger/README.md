# Dagger of Sacrifice

After a while of strengthening yourself through the use of self-sacrifice, you may be keen to attempt to try sacrificing the blood of mobs. The Dagger of Sacrifice, when used on a non-boss, non-player entity next to a Blood Altar, will kill the entity in one hit and pump all of the blood into the altar, converting it into life essence depending on the quality of the mob. Normally, hostile mobs will tend to give much more LP than peaceful mobs.

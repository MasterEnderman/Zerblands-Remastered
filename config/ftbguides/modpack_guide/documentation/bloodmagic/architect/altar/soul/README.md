# Soul Network

The Soul Network (commonly abbreviated as SN) is the term for the connections between the player and all of the items and structures that they have linked their soul to. When a blood mage becomes more powerful, the strength of their soul increases and thickens these bonds. These connections are ethereal strands of the soul, and only the most powerful of Blood Magi are able to see these in their physical form. To date, no mage has attained this ability...
In-game, the Soul Network is tied directly to the player. The data is stored inside of the world, and every player has only a single network - the LP placed into the network is not stored in any item, but is instead placed and drawn from a single pool.
To bind things to your network, the most common way is to simply right click an item that uses a network to power itself. Once bound, the item will indicate that it is owned by you and it can never be unbound (with current technology). If this item is used and it has an LP cost attributed to it, it will take the LP from the owner's network. If there is not enough LP in this network, it will take the missing LP directly from the user's health (not the owner's). Be careful when using items when you have a low amount of LP - it could end up being deadly.

# Charging Rune

The Charging Rune is one of those beauties that will completely change the operation of the Blood Altar to something that can be seen as more useful for one-stop crafting. By syphoning off the LP from the Blood Altar slowly, the Charging rune begins storing "Charge," an internal value of the Blood Altar that can be seen using the Sigil of Sight. If the Blood Altar has enough Charge when it gets something to craft, it will use the required Charge up immediately and craft the item instantaneously. If there is not enough Charge, the Charge is all used to increase the progress of the item at a 1:1 Charge:LP ratio.
The maximum amount of Charge that can be stored in the Blood Altar is a function of the number of Charging Runes that it has multiplied by the current capacity of the altar (the capacity of the altar only comes into effect if it is greater than 20k). The rate that it charges is also related directly to the speed of the altar times the number of Charging Runes it has, and it will convert LP into Charge once every 20 ticks (one second). So if you were to design a Blood Altar with this rune, careful consideration will have to be made for all of the synergistic relationships that it has.

# Speed Rune

The speed rune applies a pressure to the altar's basin, forcing the transmutation process so that crafting is a lot quicker. Each speed rune increases the consumption of the altar by +20%% per rune, effectively increasing the speed of the altar. This also affects the speed at which the blood orbs are filled by the altar at the same rate per rune.

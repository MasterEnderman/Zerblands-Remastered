# Displacement Rune

By default, the transfer of LP between the buffer and main tanks is limited to 20LP/s. For systems that want to remove and re-add LP to the altar this speed is a sluggish crawl. That is where this rune comes into play.
The Displacement Rune increases the amount of LP transferred per operation. Each rune multiplies the transfer rate by 1.2x, stacking multiplicatively. So one rune would be 24LP per operation, two runes would be 28.8LP per operation, and three runes 34.56LP. If you have 20 runes on an altar, this jumps all the way up to 767LP per operation - that would clear a full altar in only 13 seconds.

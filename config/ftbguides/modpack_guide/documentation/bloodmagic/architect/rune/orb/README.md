# Rune of the Orb

Initially, this rune can be seen as somewhat useless. By thickening the ties between the blood orb in the altar and the Soul Network, the Rune of the Orb increases the maximum capacity of a blood orb filled by a Blood Altar by +2% per rune, additively. For something like the Weak Blood Orb, this is just +100LP capacity, however for the Master Blood Orb this is a remarkable +20kLP capacity per rune. If you have a high tier blood orb and a few extra runes to spare on your altar, this may be something to round out your network.

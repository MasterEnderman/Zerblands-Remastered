# Rune of Augmented Capacity

The Rune of Augmented Capacity functions similar to the Rune of Capacity in the sense that it increases the capacity of the Blood Altar. However, multiple runes on the same altar will begin to resonate with each other, increasing the capacity exponentially the more there are. One rune by itself will apply a +10% increase to the capacity of the altar, however this functions multiplicatively with other Runes of Augmented Capacity: if there are two runes, it is a +21% increase, three runes is +33.1% increase, etc.
Unfortunately, this multiplicative effect does not stack with the Rune of Capacity, meaning you will still only get the +2kLP bonus per rune.

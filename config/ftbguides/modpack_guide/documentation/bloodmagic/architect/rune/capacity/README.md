# Rune of Capacity

You are not exactly sure how it works the way it does, but the Rune of Capacity increases the capacity of the Blood Altar by 2kLP additively. Perhaps there is some sort of resonance effect that decreases the volume of the LP, therefore allowing you to pack more into the static basin? It does give you an idea on how to improve it further, though...
It should be reiterated that the size of the input and output buffers are 10% of the maximum capacity of the main tank, so these runes will increase the buffer capacities as well.

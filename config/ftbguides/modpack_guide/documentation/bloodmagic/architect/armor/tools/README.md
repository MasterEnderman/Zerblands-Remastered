# Bound Tools

Similar to the Bound Blade, these Bound Tools (pickaxe, axe, and shovel) will eventually be modified to fit better in the mod. Like the Blade, the tools have an active and inactive mode that can be toggled between by shift-right clicking them.
Something that these tools have is something called "Beast Mode". If you hold right click, you can charge up the tool and unleash a powerful cleave that will instantly break the blocks that can be broken by the given tool - when fully charged, this is an 11x11x11 cube above you at a cost of 10kLP. Be careful with this powerful tool, since it may be your last!

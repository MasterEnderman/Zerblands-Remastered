# Bound Blade

The Bound Blade is an artifact from the past, a blade that is created by binding an entity to a sword in the same process that creates the Living Armour. It should be noted that this, as well as the Bound Tools, will change in later versions of the mod.
The sword has an active and inactive mode, which can be toggled by shift-right clicking. The sword does not deal any damage at all when inactive, but while active there will be a small LP drain over time. Likewise, when you damage a mob you will drain LP from your network. Sure, you have a lot of damage, but it may kill you!
When a monster is killed, the monster has a chance to drop a Weak Blood Shard. These shards are used in order to upgrade your Blood Altar to a T4 altar.

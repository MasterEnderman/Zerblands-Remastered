# Magician Blood Orb

Another tier, another Blood Orb. This time, in order to progress further in the mod you will have to craft yourself the Magician Blood Orb. In the default recipe you can see that it takes 25kLP in order to craft, however the maximum capacity of the Blood Altar is 10kLP. This means that for a successful craft to occur you will need to add LP into the Altar while it is in the process of crafting the orb. Be prepared, since it can be a difficult task if you do not have everything you need!

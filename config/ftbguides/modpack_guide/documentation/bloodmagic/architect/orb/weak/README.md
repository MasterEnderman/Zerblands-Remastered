# Weak Blood Orb

What good is any mage without a power source? A Blood Orb is a device that consumes physical LP and transfers it into the owner's Soul Network. Although not a battery itself, it does act as a conduit in order to fill up the power reserves of the blood mage.
The Weak Blood Orb is the first such orb that you can make. By infusing a diamond inside of a Blood Altar with 2 kLP, you can create this orb. When bound and placed inside of an altar with some LP in it, the orb will syphon from the basin and transfer that LP directly into the network. Each orb has a maximum capacity that can only be extended by advanced runes on the altar. For the Weak Blood Orb, this maximum capacity is 5 kLP.
Blood Orbs can also be filled directly from the player by simply right-clicking with them - this will transfer a heart of health into the orb and give you 200LP. This cannot increase past the orb's maximum capacity.
A Blood Orb can only be filled by its tier of altar or higher; this means that if you have a T3 orb, it has to be filled in an altar that is greater than or equal to T3. A simple T1 altar would not do in this situation.

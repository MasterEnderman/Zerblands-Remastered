# Demon Will Aura Gauge

In order to tell how much Will you have in a given chunk you need to have a Demon Will Gauge. When in your inventory, the gauge will display the Will in the chunk that you have in five bars in the top-left corner of the screen. You can tell how much there is exactly by shifting; numbers will appear to the right of the bars to give the amount rounded to the nearest whole number.

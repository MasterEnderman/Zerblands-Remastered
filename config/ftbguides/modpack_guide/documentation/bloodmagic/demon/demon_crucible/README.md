# Demon Crucible

The Demon Crucible is a device that is able to burn the Demon Will inside of a Tartaric Gem and other items in order to inject it into the Aura of the chunk that it is in. There are a few different ways to use the crucible: one of the simplest ways is to place a Tartaric Gem inside of the crucible by right clicking on it with a gem in your hand. The crucible will then in that case drain the Will from the gem until either the Aura is saturated with that type of Will (a max of 100 by default) or until the gem is empty.
Another mode is to use the contained Tartaric Gem to drain the Will from the Aura - this is done by applying a strong redstone signal to the crucible and then the contained gem will attempt to drain as much Will as possible.
Finally, a discrete piece of Will can be burned in the crucible if there is enough room in the Aura of that type. One example of this is a Demon Will Crystal, which has a value of 50.

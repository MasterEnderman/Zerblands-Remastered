## Bloodmagic

Varoius aspects of Bloodmagic can be automated using a **Woot Mobfarm**. You can fill your altar by building a **Woot Mobfarm** with the corresponding ritual above or below your altar.
The best mob to use for **Bloodmagic - Woot Combination** are **Villagers**. As they have a higher mass spawn count then all other mobs. That way they provide much more blood for all your needs.

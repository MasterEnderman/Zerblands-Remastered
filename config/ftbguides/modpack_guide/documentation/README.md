## Bloodmagic

Varoius aspects of Bloodmagic can be automated using a **Woot Mobfarm**. You can fill your altar by building a **Woot Mobfarm** with the corresponding ritual above or below your altar.
The best mob to use for **Bloodmagic - Woot Combination** are **Villagers**. As they have a higher mass spawn count then all other mobs. That way they provide much more blood for all your needs.

## Draconic Additions

### Chaos Stabilizer

To make your chaotic tool and armor useable they have to be stabilized first. This is done in the **Chaos Stabilizer**.
The Awakened Draconium Blocks are consumed in the stabilization process. (Keep a healthy distance to the core while the machine is running.)
You start the process by throwing your item towards the **Chaos Stabilizer Core**.

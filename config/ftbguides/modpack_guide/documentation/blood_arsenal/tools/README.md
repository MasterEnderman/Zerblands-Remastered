## Blood Infused Wooden Tools

Blood Arsenal adds in plenty of tools, such as the starting Blood Infused Wooden Tools. To get them, simply place a Log (any log will do) into a Tier II Blood Altar with 5000 LP to get a Blood Infused Log.

Blood Infused Wooden Tools are quite handy and useful for early game players who don't want to keep replacing their broken tools. The material (Blood Infused Wood) that they are made up of is living and regenerative, and the tools themselves will "grow back" and repair themselves using the holder's Soul Network and a small LP cost. The tools themselves are overall better than stone and up to par with iron.

## Blood Infused Iron Tools

If you're ready to progress down the line of Blood Magic and Blood Arsenal, set your sights on Blood Infused Iron! This material is quite a step up from Blood Infused Wood, and the tools are much stronger, and regenerate much faster than the previous tier. Do note however that the costs of regeneration are higher than the previous tier.

## Stasis Tools

Stasis Tools are incredibly powerful tools with extremely high potential that can be upgraded like Living Armor. Crafting is done through the Infusion de Sanguine ritual (in the Ritual spoiler), and certain modifiers can be added onto the tools.

Modifier recipes can be viewed in JEI, by looking at the usages of a Master Ritual Stone or a Stasis Tool and going to the Infusion de Sanguine tab. Upgrades can then be applied to the tools (default Level I), and the more you use the tool and the upgrade, the more experience the modifier gets. When you get enough experience with the modifier, you will see a + icon on the tooltip next to the modifier indicating that it's ready to be upgraded to the next level. Place it into the Infusion de Sanguine ritual with the appropriate items and amounts and it will then be upgraded to the next level!

If you want to remove Modifiers from your Stasis Tool, throw the tool into the Sound of the Cleansing Soul and Modifier Tomes with their respective modifiers will pop out. To add Modifier Tomes back to a Stasis Tool, put the Stasis Tool into your offhand and right-click the Modifier Tome with your main hand.

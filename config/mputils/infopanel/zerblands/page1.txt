Beyond the world we know and the world we don't; beyond the desolate cities frozen in tine within in the Antartic wastes,
where the Elder Things once prospered; beyond the sunken city of R'lyeh in the abyssal depths, where dead Cthulhu lies dreaming;
beyond the far planet of Yuggoth in the black aether of space, where the intrepid Mi-Go pick away at the boundries of natural science;
beyond even that unnamable, nuclear chaos at the universe's core, where the blind idiot god Azathoth is held dormant under cacophonous music of eternity.

Azathoth
--------

Outside the ordered universe is that amorphous blight of nehtermost confusion which blasphemes and bubbles at the center of all infinity - the boundless
daemon sultan Azathoth, whose name no lips dare speak aloud, and who gnaws hungrily in inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond time and space amidst the muffled,
maddening beating of vile drums and the thin monotonous whine of aacursed flutes.

Yog-Sothoth
-----------

Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog.Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and the guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth.

Shub-Niggurath
--------------

Ever praises and abundance to the Black Goat of The Wood. Ia! Shub-Niggurath, The Black Goat of The Wood with a Thousand Young!

Nyarlathotep
------------

Into the lands of civilization came Nyarlathotep, swarthy, slender, and sinister. Men advised ine another to see Nyarlathotep, and shuddered. 
And where Nyarlathotep went, rest vanished; for the small hours were rent with screams of a nightmare.

Cthulhu
-------

They worshipped, so they said, the Great Old Ones who lived ages before there were any men, and who came to the young world out of the sky. Those Old Ones were gone now,
inside the earth and under the sea; but their dead bodies had hold their secrets in dreams to the first men, who formed a cult which had never died.

THAT IS NOT DEAD WHICH CAN ETERNAL LIE, AND WITH STRANGE EONS EVEN DEATH MAY DIE

Mostly figuring out how to actually mod minecraft. Something I wanted to do for the longest time. One mod I forked and worked on since is Embers."

I guess it's just another thing that has to be delayed until v2.3.0. Speaking of that version I almost want to start working on it, but that would probably mean that"

# Installation - English

As you may have noticed, the modpack currently does not start through the Curseforge app. This is due to the ancient Java version used in the background to launch Minecraft. While it is possible to fix this by assigning a more recent Java version, it would need to be done before each modpack launch, which I find quite cumbersome. Therefore, here is a guide on how to bypass this inconvenience.

1. Download the [latest Java](https://adoptium.net/temurin/archive/?version=8) "JDK" (Java Development Kit).
2. Install the new JDK.
   - I prefer JDK over JRE as it allows the use of additional arguments.
3. Download the [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/download/).
4. Install the Prism Launcher.
   - In the `Settings`, you can now select the installed Java version.
5. Click on `Add Instance` -> `Curseforge`.
6. In the search bar, look for `Zerblands`.
7. Select the current version and click `Install`.
8. A window will open, informing you that 2 mods need to be downloaded manually.
9. Click on `Open Missing Mods`. Two browser tabs will open. Let the mods download into the Downloads folder.
10. The Prism Launcher should now have found the two mods in the Download folder (they will be highlighted in green).
11. Confirm with `Ok` and let the modpack install.
12. In the top right, you need to link a Microsoft account.
13. You should now be able to start the modpack!
14. Optionally, transfer possible files from the old pack:
    - `journeymap` folder
    - `hei_bookmarks.ini`
    - `options.txt`
    - `servers.dat`

## Introduction

Zerblands is a Modpack containing some well known mods, but most of the recipes got edited so that there is a new progression line the player has to follow to play through this modpack.

This Modpack also contains a questbook, which guides the player through the different stages of the pack. Furthermore there is patchouli guide, that shows the player useful information, like ore generation values and useful tips on how to play through the modpack.

## Roadmap

With **version 2.1.8** the second packmode (called `Nightmare Mode`) can be accessed from within the pack. After changing the packmode you need to restart the pack. The new packmode comes with it's own questbook and new challenges to overcome. I'm still working on further improving the packmode as well as fixing most of the bugs while they come up.

With **version 2.2.x** the `Nightmare Mode` is basically finished besides balancing some recipes as well fixing a few loop holes I created while developing the packmode.

With **version 2.2.7** the available block IDs will be completely used up and I can't free up any of them without breaking compatibility with older worlds. I still plan to optimize and document as much of the modpack as possible before starting to work on version 2.3.x and beyond.

With **version 2.3.0** the `Nightmare Mode` will become the default mode as the now called `Legacy Mode` won't get any further updates (besides bug fixes). I'm still working on fixing the balance for some parts of the end game as I slowly approach it in my own playthrough. If you have any feedback feel free to open an issue on github. :) Furthermore version 2.3.0 will break any worlds created in an older version, so I recommend finishing your playthrough, before updating to version 2.3.0 otherwise you will lose all of your progress as I will clean up a lot of block ids, which breaks compatibility with older worlds. Stay tuned for further updates!

What do players think about this modpack?

### [Fwengum](https://www.curseforge.com/members/fwengum/projects)

> [!NOTE] What Fwengum has to say about Zerblands-Remastered:
> It's actually one of the best expert packs I've played in my 10k hours of modded minecraft. I absolutely love your pack. The combination of all these mods that makes you rack your brain to do some automation scheme a little differently than you're used to. And I really want it with a minimum of bugs and exploits.

### [Xetaxheb](https://www.curseforge.com/members/xetaxheb/projects)

> [!NOTE] What Xetaxheb has to say about Zerblands-Remastered:
> I appreciate all the effort, time, and most importantly thought that's gone into zerblands' changes... and also f-you for betraying my assumptions at every turn, left only to react with "well, that makes sense.."
> It feels much more terrafirmacraft-y in its deliberateness of changes and actions, unlike say something like gregtech derivatives where the goal is "do a bunch of busywork steps to make the number bigger (lv-mv-hv-etc)". This feels amazing and comprehensive and I'm only at caminite blend. It doesn't feel any kind of unfair yet, like some grindy or difficulty-added packs tend to be. The recipe and mechanic changes seem to be just inconvenient enough to warrant the time invested without being so ridiculous so as to feel "un-fun"; but again the most important part is they make perfect sense... like the charcoal in coke oven, making coal finally worth something again (also wood pile in coke oven, bless you). As another example, I've never been a fan of reduced log->plank->stick ratio, but the saw is just barely inconvenient enough that it doesn't feel like a chore to get (combined with planks losing a lot of inherent value from framing sheet recipes existing, while still being necessary for treated wood).
> Coming from someone who'd played dozens (hundreds?) of packs and many thousands of hours of modded and is moderately familiar with or at least aware of pretty much every mod that has ever existed for the past 13 years, thank you for this masterpiece in modpack development.
> Also, I absolutely loathe immersive engineering but seeing it integrated isn't making me want to die for once, so that's nice.
